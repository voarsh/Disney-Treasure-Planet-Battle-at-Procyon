IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01AMELIA01
"Mister Hawkins. Thank you for joining us this morning. For those of you coming from other training academies I am Admiral Amelia and it is my job to usher you into full service with this final series of exercises."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01AMELIA01A
"All vessels are to use dummy loads in their weapons and pay strict attention to my commands."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01AMELIA02
"Now, you may have noticed the three Fast Frigates from Her Majesty's 32nd Strike Flotilla. These distinguished ships have volunteered to be your targets for the first scenario. You students will set a course to bring your flotilla to the West of the Montressor Archipelago."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01AMELIA02A
"Swing South below the Archipelago, then attack the Frigates by cutting through the small islands to engage them on the other side. This exercise will test how well you've learned to use the speed and maneuverability of smaller craft. Consult your maps and set course now."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01AMELIA03
"Ahem. Would you like to set a proper course and rejoin the rest of the class, Mister Hawkins?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01AMELIA04
"There are the Frigates from the 32nd now. Students, attack! Try to get as many torpedo strikes as you can in two minutes."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01AMELIA05
"Nice job, students. Now re-form and escort the target group to the Southern edge of Clarke's Nebula."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01AMELIA05A
"Should you get ahead of the group, wait at the nebula for the other ships to join you."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01AMELIA06
"Cease fire, Mister Hawkins! The whales may look placid, but they have a nasty temper and you are in a very small ship."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01AMELIA07
"Right then, welcome to Clarke's Nebula! Red flag ships head around the nebula's West edge; blue flag ships head along the Eastern edge. When you meet again at the Northern tip of the nebula you will engage the other team in battle. May the best crews win!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01AMELIA08
"Red and Blue teams, engage! And remember, when a flag turns black it means that ship is considered destroyed and all its systems will deactivate until the end of the battle."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01AMELIA09
"Congratulations winners! A fine battle, well fought by all and I hope those of you unfortunate to be black-flagged have learned a valuable lesson or two."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01AMELIA10
"Now then, while our friends from the 32nd Strike Flotilla return to Crescentia, the rest of us will continue with the remaining exercises. Students! Form up behind me and follow my course."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01AMELIA11
"We will be using live ammunition for this next exercise. Dock with the supply Tender to re-arm. You first, Mister Hawkins."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01AMELIA12
"Now then, all ships enter the asteroid belt South of here for target practice. It's time for you to experience the raw power of your weapons when using live ammunition. You may fire when ready. I'll halt the exercise when I think you've had enough practice."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01AMELIA13
"Blast and bother! Cease fire! I've just gotten word that the Royal Navy Tender Providence is under attack by pirates. We're the only group close enough to stop the blackguards from running off with the Tender! "
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01AMELIA13A
"Break off and head due South at full speed. Engage any pirate vessel you see and show them what it means to poach this close to Crescentia! But be careful, this is not an exercise anymore -- the pirates will be firing real laser cannons."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01AMELIA14
"You're lucky I came along, Mister Hawkins. Too big of a job for you, eh?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01AMELIA15
"Now, now. We all can't get a medal our first day out. Show some of that ingenuity and bravery you demonstrated on Treasure Planet, and I'm sure you'll do fine. For now though, gather up those pirate Longboats and take those ruffians prisoner."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01AMELIA16
"Very nice work, Lieutenant Hawkins! I knew you had it in you. Nothing like finishing the day with a little scrap against some blackguards, eh? "
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01AMELIA17
"A fine day's work. Now, gather up any pirate Longboats you can see and take those ruffians prisoner."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01JIM00
"You heard the Admiral, Mister Onyx! Let's get out there and be the first to hit 'em."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01JIM00A
"Yes Ma'am. Right away! Just having a little trouble with the helm!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01JIM00B
"Aye, Ma'am!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01JIM00C
"Look Mister Onyx! Orcus galacticus! Spotting them is supposed to bring good luck!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01JIM00D
"Sorry Ma'am! A minor malfunction in our targeting system. Won't happen again!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01JIM00E
"Aye, Ma'am! Docking now!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01JIM01
"Personal Log, Jim Hawkins, Ensign. Entry # 57: I hate final exams. I wasn't this nervous when pirates were chasing us all over Treasure Planet."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01JIM02
"I shouldn't be this tense at all. I mean, it's only my entire naval career hanging on how well my crew and I do during this graduation exercise. I've been assigned the command of a stinger class torpedo boat. A sweet little craft, fast and maneuverable... but still, it's a lot more than the solar surfer I'm used to."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01JIM03
"LINE REMOVED - SHOULD NOT APPEAR IN GAME"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01JIM04
"Now if I can only keep my voice from shaking when I give commands, I should be in business. Here's hoping I manage to get us through the final exam without making any mistakes."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01JIM05
"THIS LINE HAS BEEN HANDED OVER TO MR. ONYX. THE NEW FILE IS M01ONYX00. THIS STRING SHOULD NEVER APPEAR IN GAME AND REMAINS HERE FOR REFERENCE ONLY."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01JIM06
"I suppose, Admiral."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01JIM07
"Yes, Ma'am. Thank you, Ma'am! "
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01NARRATOR01
"It is the golden age of exploration."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01NARRATOR02
"Solar-powered lightships ply the Etherium of deep space, bringing colonists and trade to every corner of the galaxy."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01NARRATOR03
"But even a golden age has its dangers, some natural..."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01NARRATOR04
"...and some decidedly less so."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01NARRATOR05
"Where there are traders, there are also pirates, always ready to prey on the unwary."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01NARRATOR06
"Within the Empire, such crimes do not go unpunished. Those who would disturb the peace must face The Royal Navy. "
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01NARRATOR07
"The Queen's Royal Light Ships have protected the Empire for over two centuries. Whether fighting pirates or Procyon invaders... "
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01NARRATOR08
"...the Navy has always been victorious. Until now. Just as the Empire and the Procyons are on the verge of peace, a new menace has appeared on the frontier."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01NARRATOR09
"A menace that cloaks itself in mystery, and leaves no clue except destruction."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01NARRATOR10
"A menace that may be too powerful for anyone to defeat."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01ONYX00
"THIS LINE SHOULD NO LONGER APPEAR IN THE GAME. YOU SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO READ THIS IN GAME."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01ONYX01
"Excuse me, Sir! Maybe we should stick to the course Admiral Amelia gave us."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01ONYX0A
"Aye, Sir. Bringing the engines to full power."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M01ONYX0B
"I wouldn't know Sir. But they are certainly magnificent!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02AMELIA01
"Greetings Lieutenant. We have a bit of a mystery on our hands. It appears that there are some pirates operating in the area, but they always seem to be able to evade capture. Your job is to find out why, and to put an end to it."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02AMELIA01A
"They may be operating a small base on one of the local islands due South of here, so keep an eye out. If you discover any suspicious settlements, you are expected to capture them and take prisoners."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02FIRSTSCHOONER01
"Thank goodness you're here! A pirate vessel fulla cowards came outta nowhere and hit us hard. Their first volley took out our engines and stopped us dead in th' Etherium. It looked like they were gonna board us when they just turned and left at full speed."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02FIRSTSCHOONER02
"Couldn't tell you. I'm just glad they took off when they did, 'cause you didn't come into sightin' range for another minute or so. But seein' how you're here, and they aren't; we have a scorched engine... I don't suppose you could give us a quick tow to Norville? She's a small town just South of here."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02FIRSTSCHOONER03
"Ye have the thanks of me and my crew, Cap'n Hawkins."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02FIRSTSCHOONER04
"Gotcha, but listen here before ya go. Another Schooner by the name o' the Lady J, takes the Northern route to Crescentia. Ye might want to go and check on 'em with that blasted pirate in the area."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02JIM01
"Yes, Ma'am!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02JIM011
"Ahoy, SS Coventry. What happened? Where are the pirates?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02JIM02
"Prepare to go ashore and investigate. I am taking us in."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02JIM03
"Take us in and return fire! Neutralize those cannons!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02JIM04
"Well done! Let's dock -- I've got a few questions for them."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02JIM05
"Old enough to have taken you prisoner! Now tell me what you know about the pirate operating in this area."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02JIM06
"We'll just see about that. Now tell me where he is!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02JIM07
"Understood."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02JIM08
"Understood. I am bringing us around. Prepare to retrieve it."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02JIM09
"Maybe we can still get there in time to help! Setting course! "
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02JIM10
"Understood. I am taking us in but keep a sharp look out for the pirates; they could be coming back at any time."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02JIM12
"They must've seen us coming. But how?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02JIM13
"Of course, Sir. The Royal Navy is always ready to help."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02JIM14
"That's Norville up ahead. All hands, prepare to dock."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02JIM15
"It's still Lieutenant Hawkins, Sir, but you're welcome. We'll be returning to patrol duty now."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02JIM16
"We'll keep them safe, I promise."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02JIM17
"I bet it's from the Lady J! Changing course to pick it up. "
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02JIM18
"Yes, but we should approach slowly. They must have some way of spotting us beyond visual range. Let's see if we can find a way to sneak up on them."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02JIM19
"Yes... I've always liked the way you think, Mister Onyx. Set a course to match speed and heading with the whales. With any luck, whatever trick the pirates are using, they won't be able to sort us out from the pod."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02JIM21
"There they are! I'm going to keep us with the pod until we're as close as possible and then break towards them. Load torpedoes!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02JIM22
"Excellent work, men! Let's round up Longboats and take the pirates into custody. Maybe now we can find out how these pirates outmaneuvered the Navy for so long."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02JIM23
"Full speed ahead. We've got to capture them!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02JIM24
"Full power to weapons and engines! Taking evasive action!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02ONYX01
"Sir, we are leaving the search area. We should head back to the island chain. "
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02ONYX02
"Sir! There is a camp on that island."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02ONYX03
"Sorry, Sir. No sign of the pirates. This camp was abandoned long ago."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02ONYX04
"Camp ahead! It looks inhabited!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02ONYX05
"Sir! They're firing on us! It must be a pirate camp."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02ONYX06
"The smugglers are surrendering, Sir!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02ONYX07
"Sir! Meteroid shower ahead! It'll tear our sails to shreds if we don't furl them or go around."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02ONYX08
"Sir! S.O.S. message rocket ahead!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02ONYX09
"It's an S.O.S. from a civilian Schooner, the SS Coventry. She's under attack North of here. The time stamp is only fifteen minutes old."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02ONYX10
"We really should pick up the message bottle, Sir. Someone could be in trouble."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02ONYX11
"We'd better hurry, Sir. That Schooner won't hold out forever."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02ONYX12
"Schooner sighted, Sir! She looks heavily damaged, but there's no sign of pirates in visual range."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02ONYX13
"Sir, we had better give them a hand. Without engine power they are easy prey."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02ONYX14
"Sir! Another message rocket! "
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02ONYX15
"You were right, Sir. The Lady J is being attacked due North of here. Should we go to battle stations?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02ONYX16
"I think I see your point sir. Would that pod of space whales help our situation?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02ONYX17
"If this plan is going to work, Sir, we need to hurry and catch up to the pod."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02ONYX18
"That's it, Sir! We've beaten them!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02ONYX19
"The pirates are already out of range! We should have stuck close to the pod. It looks like they'll try and lose us in that island chain."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02ONYX20
"It's an ambush! Grange is attacking!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02SMUGGLER01
"Yer a little wet behind the ears ta be commandin' a vessel, aint' ya lad?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_M02SMUGGLER02
"Ye'll never catch him, lad. Ol' Cap'n Grange got's an ace in his pocket that'll keep him well ahead o' you Navy boys."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS000_PLACEHOLDER_WORLDEDGE
"Hey, you're not supposed to be out here! I strongly suggest you reverse course."


// Section: TPSPEECHEVENTS001

IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M01AMELIA18
"Ensign, you need to collect those pirates before we can leave the area. Check your Star Map if you need help finding any Longboats and then round them up."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M02JIM01A
"Very well, Mister Onyx. Let's push on and see what we can find."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M02JIM06A
"That's all we need to know. Mister Onyx, let's get back on board and set a course North-East, full speed."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M02SMUGGLER03
"OK! OK! No need ta get tough! I'll tell ya cause it won't do ya any good anyway. Grange said something 'bout hunting North-East o' here."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M03JIM01
"Congratulations, men! I've been informed that we have been given a Warsloop. Between it and this torpedo boat we're an actual patrol squadron now!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M03JIM02
"Mister Onyx, plot us a course to Crescentia. We have a hold full of prisoners to deliver to the Royal Courts."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M03JIM03
"Too late!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M03JIM04
"For a moment there, I wasn't sure we were going to make it through that."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M03JIM05
"Make a note never to do that again. Time to get our bearings. What's our status, Mister Onyx?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M03JIM06
"He's not engaging. Probably going for help. Are we in any shape to pursue?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M03JIM07
"I'll bet you a month's pay he'll be back -- with friends. We'd better hide in these asteroids."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M03JIM08
"All right. Tell me the moment the engines are fully back on line, and we'll make a run for it. Until then, I'll keep maneuvering us deeper into this asteroid belt on whatever power we have left."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M03JIM09
"They must want to drive us out and into the range of their main force. Give me whatever maneuvering power you can. Power up the weapons! We have to hold them off!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M03JIM10
"I think you're right, Mister Onyx. Too dangerous for us to tackle alone."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M03JIM10A
"Morphy? What is it? You think that's Silver's ship out there?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M03JIM11
"All right, this mystery will have to wait for another day. Right now we have to get out of this trap! Set a course for Crescentia. All ahead emergency power!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M03JIM12
"Fire on targets of opportunity, but we can't forget about the larger pirate force pursuing us. We have to break through to Crescentia, or they'll crush us in the middle."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M03MORPHY01
" "
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M03ONYX01
"Aye, Sir! Projecting your heading now. We should be careful, though; the harbormaster says there may be a full-blown solar storm out there."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M03ONYX02
"Sir! The storm is bearing down on us! We've got to get away!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M03ONYX04
"I had... my doubts as well, Sir."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M03ONYX04B
"Sails damaged and down to 20 percent. Engine at 15 percent. It will be slow going until we can make repairs Sir, there could be pirates in the area. We should hide in that asteroid belt while the crew makes repairs."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M03ONYX05
"Pirate sloop ahoy!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M03ONYX06
"No, sir."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M03ONYX07
"They are definitely hunting us, Sir. We'll need more time for repairs, if we're going to rely on speed to escape."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M03ONYX08
"Sir! The smaller pirate craft have found us and are closing in to attack."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M03ONYX09
"Sir, that big pirate vessel is getting dangerously close. She must be their commandship."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M03ONYX10
"Sir! The engines are at full power!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M03ONYX11
"Sir, those smaller pirate craft are trying to intercept us. Should we engage?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M03ONYX12
"You've brought us home safely, Sir. I'll prepare the docking lines."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04CREWMAN01
"Thanks for the rescue, Cap'n! We'd sail with you any day!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04FRIGATECAPT01
"That was a timely assist, Captain Hawkins. I'll be sure to make a note of your skill and bravery in my report."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04JIM01
"Ahoy RLS Dauntless! What happened? Why aren't you up-current with the rest of the fleet?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04JIM01A
"I think we got caught in the same storm, Sir."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04JIM02
"But Sir, the Etherium surge is just about over. If we don't get back into the current soon, we'll never make it to the frontier in time to help fight the Ironclads!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04JIM03
"I know, but if we stay, we'll never get to help fight the Ironclads!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04JIM04
"You're right... Admiral Nelson! You should move back into the current with the fleet. We have special tracking equipment aboard. We'll find the missing ships and make sure they all get back to Crescentia safely."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04JIM05
"Yes, Sir! We can do the job. I give you my word as an officer and a gentleman... we'll bring those crews home!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04JIM06
"Thank you, Admiral Nelson. And good hunting to you!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04JIM07
"Ahead slow, let's try and tow them clear."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04JIM08
"We're glad we found you. Do you need an escort back to the rally point?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04JIM09
"Bring the engines up to attack speed, Mister Onyx! Let's save that Tender."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04JIM10
"Well done, men! Prepare to take the Tender under-tow and get her back to the rally point. Keep a close eye out for more pirates."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04JIM11
"They've gotten away with the Tender! We failed those men. Bring us around, Mister Onyx."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04JIM12
"Well, that's another vessel safe. Now let's go find the others."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04JIM13
"She must have entered the Crow Nebula. Our scan-map can't see what's inside the nebula's clouds. We'll have to go in and search the old-fashioned way."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04JIM14
"Aye. And that is exactly what I'm afraid happened to the Swiftsure. All ahead slow."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04JIM15
"It's the Swiftsure! I'm bringing us into hailing range."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04JIM16
"I can imagine. Well, just stay on our stern and I'll plot us a course out of this place."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04JIM17
"I see it. Changing course to investigate."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04JIM18
"The Cutter must be trying to tow the Frigate out of the asteroids. Let's help clear their way out. All gunners engage and destroy incoming asteroids."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04JIM19
"Ok, let's not panic. Round up the lifeboats and prepare to take the Frigate under tow."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04JIM20
"We have to help them! Prepare to pick up lifeboats and escort the Cutter out of danger. We can't let it be destroyed too."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04JIM21
"Pick up the lifeboats. We lost their Cutter and Frigate, but at least we can save the crews."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04JIM22
"Aye, cutting to ahead slow, but I want to get closer. If there's a disabled ship in there, she'll definitely need our help."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04JIM23
"We'll have to try and get close enough to attach towropes and help pull them free."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04JIM24
"Alright, now let's get back and save the Man-o-War."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04JIM25
"Doesn't matter, Mister Onyx. We've got to try to save them. I'm bringing us around."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04JIM26
"You're right, Mister Onyx! Prepare to come around."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04JIM27
"The Longboats aren't powerful enough to get out on their own. We have to pick them up before they start to fall back into the black hole."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04JIM28
"Excellent! Full speed out of here."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04JIM29
"That's everyone accounted for. Excellent work, crew! Let's get back to the rally point and get our lost friends back to a waystation."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04NELSON01
"Ahoy! This is Vice Admiral Nelson. We were hit by a solar storm! It blew half the fleet off the Etherium current."

"Really? You must be quite the sailor, Lieutenant Hawkins, if you made it through that storm in one piece."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04NELSON01B
"Our entire squadron was thrown out of the current and scattered across this forsaken quadrant. I've been organizing rescue and recovery up to this point, but there are still a number of missing ships out there."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04NELSON02
"I know, lad. But what choice do I have? I'll not leave my crews lost and in danger."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04NELSON03
"Are you sure, Lieutenant?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04NELSON04
"Very well, Captain Hawkins. Consider this a field promotion!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04NELSON04A
"I'll leave a Frigate and Tender here as a rally point for you while I take on the rest of the fleet. My navigator has marked the map with the last known positions of the missing ships. Well, good luck, Captain!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04ONYX01
"Sir, with our scanning map we're uniquely qualified to do this job."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04ONYX02
"I mean no disrespect, Sir, but there is glory, and then there is duty."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04ONYX03
"Sir! Navy Warsloop sighted. They appear to have been blown up onto that beach."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04ONYX04
"Captain! Pirate vessels have grappled onto that Navy Tender. They must be trying to drag her back to their base."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04ONYX05
"Sir, we really should tow the Tender back to the rally point. We can't leave her to the pirates."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04ONYX06
"There is no sign of the RLS Swiftsure, Captain."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04ONYX07
"We will have to be careful, Sir. If we go too deep into the nebula, we could lose all power."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04ONYX08
"Sir! We are picking up signs of weapons fire in that asteroid belt."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04ONYX09
"The Cutter's been hit and is breaking up!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04ONYX10
"We are coming up on the Vanov Black Hole, Sir. Recommend extreme caution and that we keep our distance."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04ONYX11
"Aye, Sir. Preparing lifeboats... just in case."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04ONYX12
"My apologies, Sir, you were right. There's a Tender and a Man-o-War, trapped in the tides of the black hole."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04ONYX13
"Yes, Sir! But remember, if we get too close to the center we'll be trapped as well, and no one will escape!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04ONYX14
"The Tender is out of the black hole's gravity field now and they're safe."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04ONYX15
"But Sir, they're too close to the center!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04ONYX16
"Sir! We're too close to the center! We have to turn back!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04ONYX17
"The Man-o-War is breaking up... I'm sorry, Sir."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04ONYX18
"Sir! We must rescue them faster. They're approaching the point of no return."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04ONYX19
"The last lifeboat is aboard!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04ONYX20
"The lost vessels must be around here somewhere. Perhaps you should consult the map again."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04SLOOPCAPT01
"Thanks for the tow. We were stuck fast."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04SLOOPCAPT02
"We should be fine. Thanks again!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04SWIFTSURECAPT01
"Ahoy! Thank Neptune someone found us! The storm destroyed our compass and blew us into the nebula. I thought we'd be lost forever."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS001_M04SWIFTSURECAPT02
"Thanks again, Captain Hawkins! We can get to the rally point on our own from here."

IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05ALAMAYOR01
"Thank you for the supplies. We need them more than ever with the blockade in force."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05ALAMAYOR02
"Boats from the neighboring island of Alzrand have started plundering our moonfish stocks. When we objected, they used their larger fishing fleet to blockade our harbor! Our fishermen have to stay docked, while they take the fish that have fed our village for generations."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05ALAMAYOR03
"Look, there they are! Fishing our territory!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05ALAMAYOR04
"They were in our fishing grounds!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05ALAMAYOR05
"Yes."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05ALZRCAPT01
"...or what?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05ALZRCAPT02
"Very well, but there is more to this than they're telling you!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05ALZRMAYOR01
"With your warships in my harbor, I could hardly refuse. As to what has happened, a few weeks ago pirates began marauding our traditional fishing areas South of here."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05ALZRMAYOR01A
"We had no choice but to move our fishing fleets North. But when we tried to explain our problem to the Alamein fishing boats, they ignored us and tried to cut our nets."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05ALZRMAYOR02
"Yes, Sir!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05BASECOMM01
"First of all, Jim, let me say that the Admiralty is impressed with your actions and the way you stepped up to take charge of recovering the damaged fleet."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05BASECOMM02
"A lot of brave individuals owe you their lives. Congratulations: your field promotion has been approved. You are now officially promoted to Captain and have been assigned this Cutter. She's got more cannons and armor than the Warsloop."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05BASECOMM03
"Yes, yes. I passed on your request for commendations for your crew, but remember this; a crew is only as good as their Captain."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05BASECOMM04
"Now, on to your next mission. Most of the fleet is on the frontier trying to hunt down these so-called Ironclad Raiders. So, we'll need you to be twice as vigilant in protecting the home sectors. "
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05BASECOMM05
"I need you to patrol the islands and visit the stations and towns in this area. The Quartermaster has supplies that must be delivered to Alamein, so make that your first port of call."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05BASECOMM06
"Very well, Captain Hawkins. A good voyage to you. Dismissed."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05JIM00
"Prepare to dock!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05JIM01
"Thank you, Sir. But it was my crew who did the work."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05JIM02
"Understood, Sir. I'll go prepare my crew."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05JIM03
"Hmmmm... It looks like a blockade. I wonder what they're doing? Wait... they're moving off now. They must have seen our flags."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05JIM04
"Yes, Mayor, I spotted those fishing vessels in front of your harbor. What is going on?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05JIM05
"They are imperial citizens, as are you. You are all protected by law and the Royal Navy. Come with us, we'll sort this out."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05JIM05A
"Mister Onyx! Set a course for Alzrand Island. All ahead full."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05JIM06
"Attention Alzrandian fishing fleet. We're heading to Alzrand on official Navy business. This is an illegal blockade. Make way."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05JIM07
"Gunners, load practice charges. Prepare to fire a warning shot across their bow."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05JIM08
"That was your only warning! In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, disband this blockade or you will face charges."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05JIM08A
"I should hope so. Mister Onyx, let's head in to the Alzrand dock and have a little chat with their Mayor."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05JIM09
"Thank you for meeting with us, Mayor Krell."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05JIM10
"Is this true?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05JIM11
"You might at least have listened. I'll deal with the pirates, but in the meantime your fleets will share the Northern fishing areas. Is this clear?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05JIM12
"There's the pirate base. All hands to battle stations!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05JIM13
"Without ships they won't be able to get off this island before Waystation Grant sends a prison barge for them."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05JIM14
"I noticed that too, Mister Onyx. And they were using powerful lancers... I didn't think pirates had that kind of weapons technology."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05JIM15
"Very strange. I'll have to make a report to the Admiralty about this. In the meantime we have a patrol to finish. Set course for the Tabrak Islands."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05JIM16
"Message rocket ahead! Changing course to retrieve it."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05JIM17
"What does the message say?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05JIM18
"It's enough. Battlestations! Full emergency speed!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05JIM19
"There's the Valiant! She's hurt badly, but we might be able to save them. All gunners prepare to engage pirate vessels!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05JIM20
"Curse them! They must be going back to attack the Procyon diplomats."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05JIM21
"The pirates must be trying to prevent the peace treaty from being signed!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05JIM22
"Careful not to hit the diplomatic fleet. We don't want to restart the war by accident."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05JIM23
"That's Silver's flag! Morph was right. That big pirate ship is John Silver's! I just can't believe he'd lead this attack! Helmsman, plot me an intercept course. I've got to find out what's going on once and for all."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05JIM24
"You're right as usual Mister Onyx. Helmsman, belay that order and stay with the Proc fleet."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05JIM25
"All right! Now, that the pirates are finished, we can track down Silver's flagship and get some answers."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05JIM26
"Umm, you're welcome... Sir. But we have to track down the pirate commandship immediately, so if you'll excuse us..."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05JIM27
"I suppose we could escort you back to Waystation Grant. Would that be acceptable, Mister Ambassador?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05JIM28
"...I suppose that will be a great comfort to their families, Mister Ambassador. Please form up behind my vessel. Setting a course for Waystation Grant, all ahead slow."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05ONYX01
"Sir! There's something up ahead. A lot of boats! They look like fishing vessels!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05ONYX02
"There are pirate vessels in the area. We must not get caught between them and the base cannons."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05ONYX03
"We've done it, Captain! The pirates are surrendering."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05ONYX04
"Speaking of bases, Sir... this one seems much larger than it needs to be, if it's only here to service the pirate fleet we just fought."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05ONYX05
"I thought only the Procyons have been able to make lancers more powerful than the light ones our Navy uses."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05ONYX06
"It's an S.O.S. from the RLS Valiant. They've been escorting the Procyon diplomatic fleet on its way to the peace treaty signing."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05ONYX07
"It's hard to decipher. The rocket's been badly damaged by weapons fire. Under attack... Silver... pirates... the Procyons are... Sorry Sir, that's all I can make out."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05ONYX08
"I-I'm not seeing any lifeboats, Sir. The pirates are turning back the way they came."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05ONYX09
"Diplomatic fleet spotted. The pirates are not stopping."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05ONYX10
"Sir! We have to save the Procyon fleet first."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05PROCAMBASS01
"Attention brave ships of the Royal Navy. Please accept the thanks of all the Procyon people."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05PROCAMBASS02
"But what of our continued safety? We are prohibited by the cease-fire agreement from using our own weapons in your territory. Not even to defend ourselves from marauders such as those who destroyed our brave escort."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M05PROCAMBASS03
"Very much so. We are even more indebted to you. Surely no more cowardly raiders will threaten us while we are guarded by the force that defeated their brothers so utterly. And let me also say that we deeply regret the loss of your Royal Navy brethren. We will remember them in our battle prayers."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06JIM01
"Yes, I can see how easy it would be to go missing in there."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06JIM02
"Aye, let's stay clear."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06JIM03
"Let's check her out. Helmsman, bring us alongside."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06JIM04
"Any clues as to who did it or where the crew is?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06JIM05
"They must've damaged the ship too heavily to make it worth stealing. Let's hope the crew is still ok... wherever they are."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06JIM06
"No. They're too high up to be used by pirates. But keep an eye on them, just in case..."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06JIM07
"I thought those things were just fairy tales! All ships come about hard! Steer clear of their islands! We'll try to avoid catching the dragons' attention!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06JIM08
"All ships, evasive maneuvers! Gunners, open fire! Try to drive the dragons away."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06JIM09
"The dragons must have driven off her crew. We can probably salvage her. Let's pull along side so we can put a skeleton crew aboard."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06JIM10
"They must be on lookout. We've got to capture them before they can get away. All ships full speed ahead! Boarding parties stand ready!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06JIM11
"Excellent work. Have you gotten any information out of them?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06JIM12
"Nicely done, Mister Onyx. Set a course North-West, ahead slow. I want to sneak up on these pirates if we can."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06JIM13
"Blast the luck! All right, Mister Onyx. Keep us in close pursuit. I guess the pirates will know we're coming now."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06JIM14
"Look at that! They look like they're building up a war fleet!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06JIM15
"I think you might be right, Mister Onyx. We'll just... Wait! Look! It's some kind of compound! I bet the crews from all those civilian vessels are being held there. We just can't leave them. What if the pirates move them out before we come back with reinforcements?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06JIM16
"Oh don't be a stick in the mud Mister Onyx. Look! We can hit the pirate's sails while they are still tied to the dock. Then keep right on going and blow open the stockade gates with our cannons."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06JIM16A
"By the time the pirates can get up speed we'll have come back around and the prisoners can use the distraction to get back to their own ships and help us. See? Simple!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06JIM16B
"Nice work crew! The gate is down! Now let's keep these pirates busy till the civilians can join the fight."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06JIM17
"Well done, crew! Mister Onyx! Get these civilians into convoy formation for the trip back to Outpost Regina. I am going to take a shore party to the pirate base and see if I can find out what this build up is all about."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06ONYX01
"These islands don't look very... inviting, Sir."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06ONYX02
"Black hole, Sir! "
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06ONYX03
"Captain! Derelict vessel spotted."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06ONYX04
"Sir, this civilian ship has been badly damaged by weapons fire."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06ONYX05
"Hard to say, Sir. But from all these harpoon marks I suspect it was pirates. The ship was definitely boarded."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06ONYX06
"Captain! Minefield! We'll have to blow them out of the sky or go around."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06ONYX07
"Sir, we spotted some strange caves on those islands. Should we send in a landing party to investigate?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06ONYX08
"Sir! Coming out of those caves! Space dragons!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06ONYX09
"Captain! The dragons are attacking!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06ONYX10
"Sir, there is a derelict Cutter ahead. It looks old, but unharmed."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06ONYX11
"Sir! Pirates ahead!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06ONYX12
"Sir! Pirate vessel captured and the prisoners are secured."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06ONYX13
"They had plenty to say when I pointed out how big the dragons are and how small their escape boat was. They say there's a refit base up North. The pirates are using it to hold prisoners for ransom and rebuild captured ships."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06ONYX14
"Sir! The pirates are getting away. We can't stop them!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06ONYX15
"Sir! That strange island ahead must be the pirate base!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06ONYX16
"It does appear that way, Sir. We should make our way back to Outpost Regina and report this."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06ONYX17
"I gather we will be attacking then, Sir?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06ONYX18
"Of course, Sir. All hands! Battle stations! We're going in!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS002_M06ONYX19
"Captain, all pirate vessels have been destroyed or captured. All the civilian prisoners have been rescued as well."

"Hang in there, Captain Hawkins! The proverbial cavalry has arrived!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07AMELIA02
"Well done, Mister Hawkins! I knew you had what it takes."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07AMELIA03
"Hmmm, yes. That was a bit of arriving in the nick, wasn't it? Oh well, extra points for showmanship and all that. Still, there would have been nothing left to save had you not stepped up and held them off."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07AMELIA03A
"Very nice trick with the space dragons, by the way. Something right out of my own playbook. You've grown into a remarkable officer, Hawkins."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07AMELIA04
"They might be stealing... or the Procs could just be selling directly to them."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07AMELIA05
"I have no proof, Jim, but mark my words: I do not trust those rodent-faced blackguards. Treaty or not -- watch your back around them. "
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07BASECOMM01
"Captain Hawkins! Just leave your report here, there's no time to go over it now. I have an urgent mission for you!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07BASECOMM01A
"Dorlinor Island has been hit by a large asteroid. The main town there has been devastated. I need you to take a load of medical supplies to them as quickly as you can."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07BASECOMM02
"It's not going to be that simple, Captain. The only ship we have that can carry enough medical supplies to them in time is a Fast Frigate."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07BASECOMM02A
"I have assigned you the one we had tied up here for maintenance. Even then, the only way you will reach the survivors in time is to take a course through the Calyan Abyss."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07BASECOMM03
"I know it's a dangerous route, but it will cut your travel time in half. Those people need our help and they need it now!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07BASECOMM04
"Good. Now a full relief fleet will be coming in behind you as quickly as they can. The Fast Frigate is loaded and ready. Select your crew and move out!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07BASECOMM05
"Good luck, Captain Hawkins. And hurry!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07JIM01
"Prepare to dock at Outpost Regina. Mister Onyx, you're in charge while I'm making our report to the base commander."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07JIM02
"Commander! I've discovered something important regarding the pirate raids!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07JIM03
"Yes, Sir! I'll prepare my squadron and cast off at once."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07JIM04
"The Abyss?! Are you sure?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07JIM05
"I understand, Sir. We will make it through."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07JIM06
"I see them. Crew to full alert! Prepare for dragon attack."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07JIM07
"I've never seen anything like that before. No time to investigate now, though! Mister Onyx, mark this location on our charts."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07JIM08
"Look at the damage! All those people... All right crew, let's dock and get these medical supplies unloaded double-time!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07JIM09
"What happened?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07JIM10
"They must have heard about the disaster and thought Dorlinor would be an easy target. Madam Mayor, get your people back to whatever shelter you can. We'll protect the town. Mister Onyx! Get our crew back aboard and let's cast off!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07JIM11
"Then we'll hold them off and distract them from the town until the relief fleet arrives! Maybe we can lure some of them into the Abyss and let the dragons deal with them."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07JIM12
"Yes, they were made for each other. Now let's go back and break up the rest of the pirates before they can land at Dorlinor."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07JIM13
"Pirates! We've got to draw their fire away from Dorlinor. Gunners engage any vessel that is firing on the town!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07JIM14
"Thank you, Admiral. We couldn't have held them off for much longer."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07JIM15
"Thank you Ma'am. Some of those pirates were really well-armed though. I've been noticing more and more Procyon weapons being used by pirates. Could they be stealing weapons from the Procs now?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07JIM16
"Ma'am?!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07ONYX01
"Sir, were we not going to check in with Outpost Regina?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07ONYX02
"This looks like a treacherous area. Our ships would be smashed in here. We really should check in with Regina."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07ONYX03
"Captain, incoming Meteor Storm! We should try and avoid it."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07ONYX04
"Sir! There are caves on those islands!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07ONYX05
"Unknown vessel sighted!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07ONYX06
"Aye, Sir."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07ONYX07
"Dorlinor Isle dead ahead, Sir. It looks bad."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07ONYX08
"Captain Hawkins! There are pirate vessels closing fast!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07ONYX09
"There are too many of them, Captain! We can't beat them all!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07ONYX10
"Excellent idea, Sir!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07ONYX11
"Well done, Sir. The dragons should keep those pirates very busy."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07TOWNPERSON01
"Captain! Thank you! As mayor of this town, let me say that each and every person on Dorlinor is in your debt. Our hospital was destroyed in the disaster."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M07TOWNPERSON02
"We were just starting the day's work when our lookouts spotted a rogue asteroid coming straight toward the island. We barely had time to get people out of their homes before it hit!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M08JIM01
"Bring the ship up to cruising speed, Mister Onyx. It's time we went back into the Calyan Abyss and see if we can find any trace of that strange vessel we spotted yesterday."

"They can't be far off, then. Let's search these nearby islands and see if we can't locate that ship again."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M08JIM04
"Let's move in. Gunners stay ready, but do not open fire without my order!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M08JIM05
"Attention unknown vessel! This is Captain Hawkins of Her Majesty's Royal Navy. You are in Imperial territory. Please heave to and state your allegiance and intent."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M08JIM06
"Unknown vessel! I repeat--"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M08JIM07
"Helmsmen! Get us out of here!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M08JIM08
"It must be one of those Ironclads that have been attacking on the frontier!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M08JIM09
"Trying to set up a forward base? I don't know, but here's a chance to find out how tough a monster like that is!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M08JIM10
"Yes, Mister Onyx, I can see that now. Helmsman! Full emergency power and set a course for Regina Station. We may not be able to handle an Ironclad, but the Station's big guns should put a dent in that thing!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M08JIM11
"It's good to be right some of the time. Make a note of its heading, Mister Onyx, while we prepare to dock."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M08JIM12
"Next time we face that thing, I want to have a couple of tricks up our sleeve. Mister Onyx, get the crew working on repairs. I have to make a report to the base commander."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M08ONYX01
"Aye, Sir. I will have the navigator plot a course back to that location."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M08ONYX02
"It's a mining camp, Sir. It looks like they were after dark matter. No one here now... but it doesn't look abandoned."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M08ONYX03
"Unknown vessel approaching, Sir. It looks to be the same one as yesterday."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M08ONYX04
"I don't think they intend to reply, Sir."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M08ONYX05
"Captain! Their guns are coming to bear!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M08ONYX06
"What would it be doing here?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M08ONYX07
"Well Sir. I believe we have established that these Ironclads are much tougher than we are."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M08ONYX08
"The Ironclad is breaking off, Sir. They seem to share your respect for Regina's siege guns."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS003_M08ONYX09
"I believe it's heading into the Darkshire Nebula, Sir."

IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09JIM01
"There's our new ship, Mister Onyx. Isn't she a beauty?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09JIM02
"We all have."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09JIM03
"Helmsman, set a course around the perimeter of the asteroid belt that surrounds the Darkshire Nebula. If that Ironclad is in the nebula, we should be able to pick him up when he comes out."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09JIM04
"Well, today we're a bit better armed. All ships attack! Let's try and capture one of these things!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09JIM05
"Helmsman, full power to engines. Plot a pursuit course."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09JIM06
"I know, but we can't afford to lose them again. Hopefully we can capture one of the Ironclads before they get too far."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09JIM07
"The Ironclads are moving out of visual range. This nebula doesn't seem to be slowing them down much."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09JIM08
"No, Mister Onyx. We'll stay on this course. Whoever is running those Ironclads must have some sort of base nearby. And I intend to find it."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09JIM09
"Looks like a graveyard for ships that got lost in the nebula."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09JIM10
"I am not about to give up just yet, sailor. Transfer our remaining energy to the Longboat so we can take a better look around."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09JIM11
"Look at that! It looks like a StarHammer Class Man-o-War. Make for her, we're going to board and have a closer look."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09JIM12
"Well look at this! There's ammunition left in this nova mortar."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09JIM13
"Well I'll be a Montressor wharf rat! This must be a re-fuelling base for those Ironclads. Looks like they've figured out how to use dark matter as a fuel source."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09JIM14
"I don't know what they're up to exactly, Mister Onyx, but it can't be good. Prepare to fire the nova mortar! Gentlemen, I believe it's time to ruin their day."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09JIM15
"I believe you're right, Mister Onyx. This could be our ticket out of this nebula! But we've got to get back to our Frigate. Now!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09JIM16
"Batten down the hatches, men! There's an explosion coming, and we're going to have to ride the shockwave out of here."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09JIM17
"Don't worry about them! Bring our stern about so it's facing the blast. We have a wave to catch! I'll take the helm myself this time."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09JIM18
"Watch and learn, Mister Onyx. This isn't something they teach you at the Academy. You're lucky to have a Captain who spent his wayward youth on a Solar Surfer!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09JIM19
"Wahooooooo!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09JIM20
"We made it! Mister Onyx! Damage report!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09JIM21
"We better make it back to base and let the Admiralty know what we've found. Who knows how many other secret bases they've set up deep in our territory?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09ONYX01
"Aye, Sir. You've earned her."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09ONYX02
"Spotters have picked up two Ironclads leaving the nebula. Same type as the one we fought yesterday."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09ONYX03
"They're breaking off, Captain! Their course will take them back into the nebula."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09ONYX04
"Are you sure, Captain?! We'll start losing power as soon as we enter the nebula."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09ONYX05
"We're losing power, sir. Our engines are down to 50 percent efficiency and dropping."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09ONYX06
"Power down to 40 percent, Sir. Shall I have the helmsman bring us around?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09ONYX07
"There are a number of wrecks dead ahead, Captain."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09ONYX08
"A situation not unlike our own, Sir. Engine power down to 5 percent and fading. We no longer have the power to make it out of here on our own."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09ONYX09
"Sir, Over here! Look, through the nebula!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09ONYX10
"But what are they doing here? Why set up a refueling base so deep within our Empire?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09ONYX11
"The nova blast has ignited the dark matter, Sir. If I remember my academy chemistry courses, we are in danger of witnessing an explosion hundreds of times bigger than the nova mortar charge."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09ONYX12
"Three Ironclads are approaching fast. I believe they've spotted us."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09ONYX13
"But Captain! There's no way a ship of this size can ride a blast wave without coming apart."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M09ONYX14
"You did it Sir. Unfortunately for the Ironclads, they didn't have the benefit of your adventurous youth."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M10ARCCAPT01
"Ahoy Royal Navy vessels! May we speak to your Commander?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M10ARCCAPT02
"We are carrying vital weapons and munitions to the frontier. We have to travel between currents here, and were wondering if you could escort us. The supplies must get through -- and there are pirates everywhere these days."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M10ARCCAPT03
"We're being fired upon! You must protect us! These weapons must not fall into pirate hands!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M10JIM01
"I'm Captain Hawkins, and I command this squadron. What can I do for you?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M10JIM02
"I understand. We'll guard you while you make transit."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M10JIM03
"I was thinking the same thing. All gunners, prepare to attack! Helmsman, keep us close to the merchantmen."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M10JIM04
"Keep moving. You'll be safe when you enter the Etherium current. My squadron will handle the pirates."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M10JIM05
"Not on my watch! Helm! Full ahead, emergency power! Gunners, take out that tow ship!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M10JIM06
"Ironclads?! Helping the pirates?! They must be trying to destroy the supply fleet. We've got to stop them!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M10JIM07
"That Ironclad is going to collide with the merchant vessel! All hands, take cover!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M10JIM08
"They must be stunned from the explosion! We'll never have a better chance to capture one intact. Draw alongside and prepare to board."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M10JIM09
"Great Neptune! They're..."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M10ONYX01
"Captain, pirates in visual range. No doubt they'll try and draw us away from the Arcturian Merchants."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M10ONYX01A
"Captain! The pirates have grappled onto one of the Arcturian vessels and are trying to tow it away."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M10ONYX02
"Captain! Ironclads on an intercept course with the merchant fleet!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M10ONYX03
"Captain! The Ironclad Cruiser is still intact, but it's stopped firing."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M10ONYX04
"We must hurry, sir. I think their gunners are regaining consciousness."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS004_M10ONYX05
"Captain, we've done it. They're surrendering!"

IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS005_M11ADMHOYT03
"But that would mean the treaty signing ceremony is..."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS005_M11ADMHOYT04
"Someone must get through to the Queen aboard Parliament. I'm assigning you the RLS Victory, a Man-o-War and the most powerful ship we have. And so that you will have no problems getting through our own people, consider yourself a full Commander now, Mister Hawkins."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS005_M11ADMHOYT05
"I am."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS005_M11ADMHOYT06

IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS005_M11JIM07

IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS005_M11JIM08

"Helmsman! Plot a pursuit course. We can't let him get away."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS005_M11JIM13

IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS005_M12JIM04

"Incoming torpedoes!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS005_M12ONYX03
"The Procyons seem to have developed a ship that can cover itself with Etherium and vanish! How can we fight what we can't see?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS005_M12ONYX04
"Sir, Procyon vessels are docking at Parliament and off-loading troops!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTS005_M12ONYX05

"Never, Jim Hawkins! All our plans were brought to nothing by you and that pirate cyborg! Neither of you will survive to enjoy your victory!"

"In a day full of surprises I found the strangest one after the battles were all over.  As we hauled the last of the pirate prisoners aboard I was surprised to hear my name called out. It was TurnBuckle, one of John Silver's old crew; a face and form I hadn't seen since my adventure to Treasure Planet, five years ago."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J01JIM02
"I thought he was going to ask to be set free because we knew each other, but all he did was stumble up to me and press a lump of dark matter into my hand. ''Silver says, 'Beware!''' was all Turnbuckle told me. Before I could question him further he ducked back into line and was herded off to the prisonship with the rest of the prisoners."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J01JIM03
"By the time I found a moment to get back to my quarters and examine the rock, my mind was filled with a thousand thoughts of the old pirate I hadn't seen in so many years. I had heard rumors of him from time to time... some whispers of his ship being seen on smuggling runs or even that he had turned privateer and was preying on Procyon shipping fleets in the name of Queen and Empire."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J01JIM04
"I was still deep in thought when little Morphy, the pet Silver had given me all those years ago, jumped up on my desk and began to chirp and spin. To my amazement, he suddenly changed into a miniature version of old John Silver and croaked, ''Beware! Beware!'', as if he understood something that had evaded me."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J01JIM05
"Despite Morphy's tricks I am no closer to an answer. Could Silver have been trying to warn me about those strange new iron ships on the frontier, or some sort of new pirate threat closer to home? Without Silver here all I have is more questions. And so I'm left to try and understand this message -- the one word that Silver had to say -- and I can't know whether it is a threat or a warning from the cyborg that befriended me years ago."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J01JIM05A
"Silver says, ''Beware!'' I would have to be."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J02JIM01
"We were lucky today. Onyx and I boarded the pirate vessel just as Captain Grange was about to throw his ''secret weapon'' overboard, to be lost in the Etherium forever."

"As near as I can tell, it's some sort of map scanner. With it, the pirate was able to see us coming long before we could see him."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J02JIM03
"I was able to contact my old mentor, Dr. Doppler, and he believes the map scanner was built by the same ancient culture that built the technology on Treasure Planet. With his help I figured out how to link this device to any standard naval navigation station."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J02JIM04
"The pirates have run circles around us for long enough. Now it's our turn! With those strange iron vessels attacking the frontier, we need every advantage we can get! Now, if I can only get the Admiralty to assign us to the frontier, we can get in on the fight!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J03JIM01
"We escaped the pirate trap and yet I am still plagued with questions about the pirate flagship I glimpsed. Mister Onyx and I questioned the prisoners but they refused to say who led them or why pirate attacks were on the rise."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J03JIM02
"Whatever questions I may have will have to wait though. We have finally received our orders to set sail and join the task force heading to the frontier. With the Procyons finally willing to sign a peace treaty, the Royal Navy is free to deal with the strange new Ironclads raiding the frontier and the bulk of the Home Fleet is preparing to move out to counter the raiders."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J03JIM03
"Our encounter with the solar storm delayed us for so long that we only have a few hours left to catch the seasonal surge of the McCullogh Etherium Current. If we make it we should be able to catch up to the main fleet within a day. If we miss the surge it'll take weeks to make it to the frontier."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J04JIM01
"We did well today. We saved vessels and men the Navy needs more than ever. Unfortunately, we missed the surge in the McCullogh Current and, with it, any chance we had of joining the fight on the frontier."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J04JIM02
"The Admiralty has dubbed these new raiders ''Ironclads''. Reports coming in say their thick, armored hulls deflect all but the heaviest laserballs. And their engines apparently don't use solar power, as no one has spotted sails on any of them."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J04JIM03
"We don't even know if this is some new enemy or an old one who's developed some new weapons technology. Every attempt to capture an Ironclad has met with dismal failure. Even when the Navy has been able to concentrate their fire enough to disable one of these monsters, some sort of self-destruct mechanism activates and then nothing remains of the Ironclad or its crew that can tell us anything."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J04JIM04
"And while all this goes on, and battles are won and lost, my crew and I patrol the home territories. Mister Onyx has noticed my disappointment and takes great pains to remind me that, ''They also serve who only stand and wait.'' I know these tasks need doing, but that doesn't make me feel any better about being left behind while our friends and former classmates risk life and limb on the frontier."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J05JIM01
"Today was the first time I had ever met a Procyon face to face. I would like to say it was a pleasant experience but I can't. They were nice enough, but there is just something about them. Something... predatory."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J05JIM02
"The Ambassador seemed very thankful we arrived in time to save them from the pirates and he even offered to mention our efforts to the Queen after the treaty signing. Their warriors, on the other hand, never said a word - they just stared down at us. Maybe they aren't allowed to speak."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J05JIM03
"The Procyon Ambassador claimed that the cease-fire prevented him from dealing with the pirates himself, but I still don't believe him. As we left the Procyon Flagship Mister Onyx noted their Star Mortar was uncovered and showed signs of being fired. If they weren't firing on the pirates then who was that mortar fired at? I don't know what to make of all this yet, but everything we saw and heard was entered into my report to the Admiralty."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J05JIM04
"In the meantime we've been re-assigned to patrol the edges of the broken territories, a series of wild and mostly unexplored island chains that form a natural barrier through the middle of the Empire. There has been a large number of civilian disappearances in the region and the Admiralty has ordered me to explore the islands to look for any trace of them."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J06JIM01
"With the pirates defeated and imprisoned in their own stockade, I was free to search their base with my shore party. The pirates were better dug-in and organized than I would ever have thought possible."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J06JIM02
"It's a good thing we caught them napping or this battle would have gone very badly. The more I searched, the more I realized that a war fleet is exactly what the pirates were building."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J06JIM03
"But nothing could have prepared me for the greatest shock of all. In the pirate commander's quarters, amidst dozens of maps and timetables showing the course of tradeships throughout the home territories, I found a single fateful message."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J06SILVER01
" "
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J07JIM01
"After the townspeople were cared for and temporary shelters were made for the wounded aboard the relief fleet, I was able to meet with Admiral Amelia to discuss some of the things I'd seen on my missions. To my shame though, I didn't implicate my old friend John Silver. I could not bear the thought of Admiral Amelia having to issue a capture order for him."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J07JIM02
"When I told her of our encounter with the Procyon Diplomatic Fleet I thought she would tear her cabin apart. She all but accused the Procs of destroying their own naval escort!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J07JIM03
"It seems the Procyon Ambassador is a former war chief and he and the Admiral have exchanged fire on more than one occasion. She made it quite clear that I was not to trust him farther than I could throw him with two cannonballs tied to his feet."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J07JIM04
"With the Empire being pressed hard by the Ironclads, peace with the Procs is more important than ever and so the Admiral can't press our suspicions without solid evidence. To that end she's ordered my squadron back into the Calyan Abyss to find any trace of the mystery vessel we spotted yesterday."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J08JIM01
"My report threw Outpost Regina into a panic. An Ironclad this deep into the Empire changes the entire nature of the battle against these mysterious raiders."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J08JIM02
"The Admiralty fears that this intrusion is some sort of attempt by the Ironclad forces to disrupt the peace treaty signing due to take place on Parliament in just a few days. The Empire can't afford to resume its war with the Procyons right now."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J08JIM03
"The Admiralty has decided that my brief encounters qualify as ''experience with the Ironclad threat'', so I have been given command of a Frigate and ordered to find the Ironclad base in the region. I hope that I can measure up to the faith and power that has been entrusted to me. We need answers, fast."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J09JIM01
"I've spent the last few hours going over our Frigate with Mister Onyx and my engineer. She's got a few more scorch marks, but is otherwise sound after her round of shockwave surfing."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J09JIM02
"Still, Mister Onyx thinks we need to put in at a drydock for a complete inspection, so I've set course for the Cydonia Shipyards. It takes us out of our patrol route, but closer to the peace treaty ceremonies. If the Procyons really are up to something, I want to be close enough to help stop them."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J09JIM03
"While I can fathom the ''why'' of the Ironclad's hidden base I'm still having trouble with the ''how'' of it. They must have had help smuggling the raw materials into the Empire. But when I try to imagine who would betray the Empire to such an enemy the only answer that appears in my mind is unthinkable."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J10JIM01
"Procyons! The Ironclad Cruiser was full of Procs and their robots! They were still recovering from the blast as we entered and even in their stunned condition they put up a pretty tough fight."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J10JIM02
"The Ironclad was cramped and full of smoke. We were nearly pushed back and over the side twice before I was able to corner and disarm the Procyon Captain."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J10JIM03
"But now that we finally know the secret of the Ironclads it may be too late. Clearly, the Procyons never had any intention of making peace. They used their Ironclads to lure the bulk of our ships to the frontier while our Queen is here signing a peace treaty in front of the guns of the entire Procyon diplomatic fleet!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J10JIM04
"And out there somewhere is John Silver and his massed pirate fleet. I don't have much choice now but to accept the fact he's working with the Procyons. If we encounter him again I will have to end this, no matter what he once meant to me. Now he'll have to be the one to ''Beware.''"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J11JIM01
"It's like my mother told me, the farther you go the more likely you are to end up at the beginning. All these years after my adventure to Treasure Planet, I find myself once again side by side with old Silver trying to beat the odds and save the day."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J11JIM02
"But this time there's more at stake than just our own lives. If we can't make it to the treaty ceremony before the Procyons spring their trap, we could find ourselves without an Empire. With the Queen and Parliament captured the royal navy would have no choice but to surrender."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J11JIM03
"Come what may, at least I know John Silver was a true friend until the end. I hope he'll never know how close I was to losing faith in him and if we both get out of this I swear I'll try and make it up to the ol' cyborg. But that can wait... it's time to pay the Procyons back for all of this. And pay them back hard."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J12JIM01
"For the rest of my days I'll never forget the sight of Silver's ship ramming into that Ironclad and saving my life. He'll always be the bravest being I've ever known, and I owe him more now than ever before."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J12JIM02
"We were still rescuing drifting sailors and picking up fleeing Procyons when the relief fleet finally arrived. Admiral Amelia had to be picked up from a Longboat after her ship was destroyed in battle. I would rather be fighting the Procs again than be the Captain that had to explain to the Admiral what took so long to get there."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J12JIM03
"After the destruction of almost all of their Ironclad ships, the Procyons begged for peace, and for real this time. The terms agreed to were a harsh price to pay for their scheming. For our part in foiling the Procyons, my crew and I were awarded the Imperial Starburst. John Silver was exonerated of all crimes and pronounced a Knight of the Empire. The old Cyborg would have laughed himself apart over that one. Sadly enough no trace of him was found after that collision and so the Empire awarded the honor posthumously."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J12JIM04
"His crew said he ordered them to the lifeboats before he took her into the side of that Ironclad. He was all alone in those final moments. The official word is John Silver gave his life for the Empire... but I know better."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J12JIM05
"That ol' pirate was too smart not to have an escape route. And he knew that the Admiralty would take a long time to clear him of the crimes his robot double committed for the Procyons. No, deep in my heart I know John Silver is out there, somewhere, beyond the frontier, fixing up some old Galleon and gathering a new crew. I just hope I'm an admiral before he gets into any more trouble!"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTSJOURNALS_J12MORPHY01
"Keep on shining, lad!"


// Section: TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL

IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTSHORTAMELIA01
"Welcome to basic training. Today we shall cover the barest necessities of controlling your ship."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTSHORTAMELIA02
"To take a look around you, right-click and hold on the open Etherium, then move the mouse around to adjust the camera. This will come in very handy during combat."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTSHORTAMELIA03
"For basic movement, left-click your mouse pointer where you would like to go on the open Etherium. A waypoint and a yellow pathing line will appear, showing the path your ship will take to reach that waypoint. "
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTSHORTAMELIA04
"To adjust your speed, click on the Speed Bar in the bottom left of the screen. Keep in mind that your ship becomes less maneuverable at high speeds."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTSHORTAMELIA05
"Located in front of your ship is a yellow objective arrow. This arrow will always point you in the direction of your current objective, so pay attention to it. Now, follow your objective arrow to the other side of the Shadow Islands. "
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTSHORTAMELIA06
"Good work. On to weapons and targeting. To fire your weapons at a target, simply move your mouse pointer over an enemy vessel. If the vessel is hostile, your mouse pointer will turn into a targeting icon. When this happens, just left-click your mouse and those weapons that are fully charged and within range, will fire. Just click on your target again to fire another barrage. "
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTSHORTAMELIA07
"Alright, test your weapons on that unmanned Target Barge over there. Try and target both its sails and hull."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTSHORTAMELIA08
"Very good. That's all for today. For more advanced instructions, you may join me in the full tutorial or check your cadet manual. Good luck, Ensign."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA01
"Alright, Ensign, are you ready to begin your field training exercises?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA02
"Today we're going to learn the basic controls needed to operate one of the Navy's Royal Lightships. If you do well here, Ensign, you'll have your chance to participate in the final graduation exercises this afternoon. I'll be right here beside you as we run through the basic operations. So pay attention to my instructions."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA02A
"Everything spoken is being recorded, so if you ever find you need to review what you've been told, simply click on the Chat button and then scroll to find what you're looking for."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA03A
"The first thing we'll cover is movement. But before we begin, you should know how to move the camera. To move the camera and see what's around you, right-click and hold the mouse pointer on the open Etherium, then move your mouse to the left or right."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA03B
"To zoom in and out, right-click and hold on the Etherium, then slide the mouse forward or back. Once you get under way, seeing what's around you is crucial. "
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA03C
"Zooming in and out is only available when the Advanced Camera Control option is enabled."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA03D
"Why don't you spend a moment practicing with the camera controls. Zoom in and you can get a good look at your ship. Zoom out and you can have a look at the surroundings."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA03E
"Full stop, Helm. Your initiative is commendable, but bear with me a moment while I review the movement controls with you properly."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA03F
"Right then. On to movement. The fastest way to get moving is to left-click your mouse pointer anywhere in the Etherium. When you do this, you'll see a waypoint, marked by a large X, and a yellow line showing the path your ship will follow. Once you've laid the waypoint, you will automatically accelerate to full speed ahead and follow the pathing line."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA04
"If you want to place more than one waypoint at a time, to maneuver around islands for instance, you may use the Multiple Waypoints button, found at the bottom of the screen. Once you've pressed this button, you may place multiple waypoints in the Etherium. Each time you left-click, another X will appear with a pathing line connecting the points. You may continue placing waypoints until you've created a path that is to your liking."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA05
"As you're placing waypoints, you'll notice a green check mark and a red X near the last waypoint you placed. Pressing the green check mark will accept the path you've chosen and start your ship moving. Pressing the red X will cancel your waypoints and allow you to start laying them out in a new pattern. To return to the single waypoint system, just press the waypoint icon again."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA06
"Keep in mind that you can adjust the speed of your vessel by clicking on the Speed Bar in the lower left hand corner of your screen. Red is All Stop, yellow is Ahead Slow, light green is All Ahead Full, and dark green is Full Emergency Speed."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA07
"As your speed changes, so too does your ability to turn. A ship traveling at a lower speed can turn more quickly than the same one traveling at high speed. Keep this in mind when you get into situations where tight maneuvering is required."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA08
"Do you see the yellow arrow in front of the ship's selection disc? That arrow represents an objective point. Follow that arrow and you won't get lost. Now, I'm going to hand over the controls to you and I want you to try maneuvering for yourself."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA09
"There's a lighthouse island nearby. Plot a course to it and remember to follow the objective arrow."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA10
"Brilliant! I knew you would catch on quickly."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA11
"As you just experienced, your sighting range is quite limited. Thankfully, the Royal Engineers and Cartographers have been diligently updating our Star Maps. These maps indicate islands, nebulae and black holes in the area, which is handy, as a spotter can only see so far."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA12
"To view the Star Map, click the Circular Blue Icon in the lower left hand corner of the screen. As you'll see, the map shows our ship near the islands where we are currently stopped. The pulsing yellow dot on the map indicates your current objective."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA13
"The upper left hand corner of the Star Map is where the mission objectives are listed. These objectives will help guide you and as a member of the Royal Navy it is your duty to complete them. The tasks in Yellow are your current objectives. Once an objective is completed, it will turn Blue. However, should you fail to complete an objective, it will turn red. Be sure to check periodically for new objectives."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA14
"Alright, Ensign, activate the Star Map now."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA14A
"Do you see the large island in the middle of the map?"
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA15
"Set your waypoints and make for that island straight away. And don't forget to use your objective arrow to help plot your course."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA16
"There's the island now. Our destination is on the South-Eastern side. Steady as she goes."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA17
"Very good. Now we're going to cover weapons and targeting. Each ship's weapons are organized into banks. You can see these by left-clicking the Skull icon on the left side of the screen. This reveals your Weapon Bar. The larger the vessel, the more weapon banks she'll have."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA18
"On this Torpedo Boat, the top icon represents the light lancers we currently have equipped. The two additional icons represent the torpedo tubes positioned on the port and starboard sides of the boat. The position of the icon shows where on your ship that bank of weapons is placed."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA19
"When a weapon is loaded and ready to fire, the weapon's icon will light up. The Recharge Bar along the left side of the icon indicates how close a weapons bank is to being loaded."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA20
"When a target is in range of a weapons bank, a green outline will appear around the weapon icon. This will happen regardless of whether the weapon bank is ready to fire or not. In the event that the weapon or the part of the ship it is mounted on are damaged, and it cannot be fired, it will be crossed off in the Weapons Bar."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA21
"Now that you know how to keep track of your weapon banks, let's review the targeting of enemy vessels. To target the enemy, simply move your mouse pointer over their vessel. The mouse pointer should turn into a targeting icon. This means the vessel is hostile and can be fired upon. If there's no targeting icon, the vessel is allied with you."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA22
"When you've selected a target, all weapons that are loaded and within range will fire. Remember, it is possible to target specific parts of a ship. For example, if you want to target the enemy's sails, click their sails, rather than the hull, with the targeting icon. Clicking on the enemy vessel again will launch another attack."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA23
"Although the target barge isn't moving, when you launch your torpedoes towards the enemy in real combat, keep in mind that the torpedoes will track them, but smaller and faster craft may be able to outmaneuver and avoid your shots. When attacking with torpedoes, move in closer to help ensure the target will be hit."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA24
"Now, show me what you've learned, Ensign. See that unmanned target barge? I want you to hit it as many times as you can with your lancers and torpedoes."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA24A
"Whenever you're ready. The Target Barge is at your leisure."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA25
"Cease weapons fire. Nice work. Of course, if one day you're lucky enough to get command of a larger vessel, you'll have to know how to operate special weapons such as Grav Charges and Mortars."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA26
"As Grav Charges and Mortars are lobbing-weapons, you have to left-click that special weapon's icon in the weapons bar to activate them. Once this is done, you'll see a targeting icon instead of your mouse pointer. Similar to giving your ship movement orders, left-clicking on the Etherium will determine where you want the shots to land."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA27
"Be sure to target the weapon within its firing arc. For example, a bow-mounted weapon cannot fire on a position behind you. And remember - these are powerful, but imprecise weapons. Be careful where and when you use them, or you're as likely to damage yourself as you are your enemies."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA27A
"I'm going to transfer you, temporarily, to the RLS Starburst. The Starburst is a Cutter equipped with one of the Navy's Star Mortars. I want you to practice firing the mortar at the target barge. Lobbing-weapons take some getting used to, but don't be shy."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA27B
"Alright, Ensign, fire at will."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA27C
"That will do. Stop the exercise."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA27D
"If the icon is red, it means that you are trying to aim somewhere outside the weapon's range and firing arc."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA28
"I've just received word that the RLS Surefire, a Torpedo Boat on exercises nearby, has damaged its engines and is requesting assistance. We've been assigned the job of towing her to a nearby Navy Tender."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA28A
"Ensign, click on the Star Mortar Icon and fire on that unmanned target barge."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA29
"To tow a friendly vessel, place your mouse pointer over it and right-click. This will bring up a series of icons. Left-clicking on the Tow icon will automatically launch a towrope. If you're out of range, move closer and reissue the tow command."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA30
"Ready, Ensign? Follow the objective arrow and let's find that Torpedo Boat."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA31
"Ah, there's the Surefire now. Get in close and issue the tow command. Once you see the rope connected to the other Torpedo Boat, follow your objective arrow to the Tender."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA32
"There's the Tender. Now we've got to break the towline to allow the Surefire to dock and make repairs. To break tow, right-click over the Surefire and then left-click the Break Tow icon. This will release the rope connecting you to them. Pull in close to the Tender and break tow."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA32B
"Tenders don't often travel outside the protected territories, at least not without an escort. But if you ever do spot one, you'll always be able to dock with it for any repairs your ship might need."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA33
"Alright then, break tow now."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA33A
"Well, I'm here. You're here. But where's the Surefire? You were supposed to find and tow the Surefire, Ensign, now get to it."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA34
"Luckily, the tender crew was able to repair the Surefire's engine. They're at full power again. I've requested that the Surefire join our group under your command."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA35
"Commanding multiple ships is part of the job. The Navy has no room for those too timid to accept responsibility. If you want to graduate from the Naval Academy, you can't be frightened of taking charge."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA36
"Now, to see what ships are under your command, simply left-click the Fleet icon on the right side of the screen. This will access the Ship Bar. The Ship Bar displays all the ships under your command."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA37
"By left-clicking on a ship's icon in the bar, you can select it and give it movement and attack commands just as you would your own Command Ship. For instance, the Surefire's Captain will take your movement and attack orders, but her Captain will set the Surefire's speed and control her weapons."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA38
"Remember, when you see the name of an auxiliary ship at the top of the screen and your weapons bar is no longer visible, you're giving orders to the Captain of that secondary ship."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA39
"Besides basic movement and attack commands, you can give your fleet Captains further instructions through the Fleet Commands button at the bottom of the screen."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA40
"By double-clicking a Ship Bar icon, you can focus the camera away from your commandship and onto secondary ships in your group. To focus back on your Command Ship you can either double-click on it in the Etherium or double-click on the ship icon at the very bottom of the screen."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA40B
"I should also mention that you may right-click on any object - be it island, town, or vessel - and you will see an eye. Left-click that icon and your camera will focus on the object. Remember, you can always double-click your Ship icons to move your focus back to your fleet."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA41
"Alright, let's head back to Port Ivy. We've got a busy afternoon ahead of us."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA42
"Ensign, I want you to put your ships into formation. To do this, left-click the Fleet Commands button and select the formation you want. The Surefire will fall into position and sail with you in that formation until you issue her new orders."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA43
"Fine work. Now it's time to dock. We'll let the Surefire dock first, Ensign. Select the Surefire from your secondary ship bar. Once the Surefire is selected, move your mouse pointer over the dock. You'll notice that an Anchor icon appears. Left-click on it and the Surefire will begin an auto-docking sequence."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA44
"Once you've issued the docking command, just let the Surefire's Captain take over. When the Surefire has docked, go ahead and follow the same process to initiate the auto-docking sequence for your own ship. If you want to cancel docking at any time, just issue a movement command and move away."

"If you don't get these ships docked soon, Ensign, you're not going to make your graduation exercises on time. Now get to it."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA44C
"We can't spend all day out here, Ensign. So if you would please be so kind as to dock right away. Thank you."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA44D
"It's always a wise idea to keep in mind where the nearest friendly dock is. If need be, you can dock with them for repairs."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA45
"Not bad... not bad at all. Unfortunately, our training run took longer than I expected, so our debriefing will have to wait till later. Everything we've covered here and additional information can be found in your Cadet Manual."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA46
"Right, now, you'd better hurry back to your quarters and report straight away to the Epsilon docks if you want to make the graduation exercises on time."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA46A
"Ahem. You were given command of TWO vessels, but you seem to have left the Surefire behind. Double-back, Ensign, find them, and then get both ships back here immediately."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA46B
"Excellent work out there. We may make a Navy officer out of you yet."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA47A
"That's twice today you've misplaced the Surefire, Ensign. Perhaps the Navy should install bells on their ships for you. Double-back, find the Surefire, and then get both ships back here immediately."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA48A
"Oh, come now. We've both got a busy day ahead of us. Let's not dawdle, shall we? Follow your objectives so we can get back to Port Ivy sometime before the day is through."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTAMELIA49A
"I admire your curious nature, but your objective is in the other direction. Now turn around and let's get a move on."
IDGS_TPSPEECHEVENTTUTORIAL_MTUTJIM00

IDGS_TPWORLDDESCRIPTION_HISTORICAL_SPIRAL_FIGHT
"When deep deposits of gold were found amongst an asteroid belt on the frontier... It was only a matter of time before the Empire, the Procyons AND the pirates all arrived to claim it."
IDGS_TPWORLDDESCRIPTION_HISTORICAL_WAR
"During the War of Retribution, the Procyon Navy sent a deep strike force to destroy the crucial Imperial Naval Base Montgomery. Only Commander Bayle and his training squadron stood in their way."
IDGS_TPWORLDDESCRIPTION_MP_AMBUSH
"The RLS Mercy was carrying much needed supplies to Shipyard Mason and, more importantly, the Royal Navy payroll -- a fortune in gold drubloons. Unfortunately for the sailors waiting for their pay, the dreaded Pirate Goldtooth got wind of the shipment and waylaid the Tender and its escorts. "
IDGS_TPWORLDDESCRIPTION_MP_ARENA_LARGE
"This blighted area of space has been a battlefield for hundreds of years. Shelter can be found amongst the outlying atolls but dragons are rumored to nest on the central rocky island -- dragons with a taste for unwary ships."
IDGS_TPWORLDDESCRIPTION_MP_ARENA_SMALL
"Keep a sharp eye out! Battle here is fast, immediate and furious. But beware the dangerous Etherium tides of the Zemyatin Black Hole. A single wrong turn could cost you your ship."
IDGS_TPWORLDDESCRIPTION_MP_BORDER_DISPUTE
"For years the Procyon Consulate have resented the presence of a Royal Navy outpost so close to their territory. The Brood Consul have decided that now is time to do something about it. For the Royal Navy, the incursion is a chance to turn the tables on the Procs in this region once and for all."
IDGS_TPWORLDDESCRIPTION_MP_CONVOY_RAID
"Pirates have set up a secret base along an important trade route. They strike from hiding, capturing or destroying as much shipping as possible before Navy help can arrive. This time it is the Royal Navy's job to make sure those vessels get through no matter what."
IDGS_TPWORLDDESCRIPTION_MP_CUSTOM_MAP
"Custom Map"
IDGS_TPWORLDDESCRIPTION_MP_DIABLO_STRAIT
"This dangerous volcanic region is split by the Stygian Etherium Current. Battling fleets can use the current to their advantage, but have to be careful not to be blasted to smithereens by volcanic rocks."
IDGS_TPWORLDDESCRIPTION_MP_IRONWAR
"A mysterious Iron Raider attacked frontier outpost Gorshin and then escaped into the Etherium. The 350th Pursuit Flotilla shadowed the iron monster until a Frigate Squadron sent from Galdrin was able to intercept. Unfortunately all the Royal Navy ships were destroyed and the raider escaped."
IDGS_TPWORLDDESCRIPTION_MP_LOCUSTS
"During the Great War, Captain Frakes, an infamous pirate leader, took up a privateer contract against the Procyons and proved to be a thorn in their side for years. His greatest victory was destroying Duke Fenras' Command fleet while it was limping back into Proc territory for repairs. Frakes used a wave of small, fast ships to overwhelm the beleaguered Procs and capture the Duke for ransom. "
IDGS_TPWORLDDESCRIPTION_MP_MOUSETRAP
"After a number of privateer raids the Procyon Navy finally tracked down a secret pirate base deep in the Procyon Expanse. While the Procyons have the pirates outgunned, the pirates have a heavily armed base at their backs."
IDGS_TPWORLDDESCRIPTION_MP_RED_ROVER
"In an attempt to roust the Royal Navy from the Far Reach Territory, the pirate clans built up an attack base within striking distance of the Imperial Outpost Osterman. They hoped that the storm season would cover them until they were ready to strike, but no such luck."
IDGS_TPWORLDDESCRIPTION_MP_SHADOW_DANCE
"This battlefield rings the massive Celeste Nebula where many a ship has disappeared forever. There is an advantage in hiding along its edges to strike an unsuspecting enemy, but should you go too deep you will join the wrecks from ages past, forever."
IDGS_TPWORLDDESCRIPTION_MP_STORMFRONT
"The notorious Captain Black and his ships tried to evade capture by dodging around the worst solar storm in a decade. Some of them made it, others were not so lucky."
